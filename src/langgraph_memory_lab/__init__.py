"""
langgraph_memory_lab

A modular codebase for LangGraph memory patterns.

Derived from tutorial notebooks covering:
- STM (Short-Term Memory): checkpoints, trimming, deletion, summarization
- LTM (Long-Term Memory): Store API, memory extraction, semantic search, personalization

Public entry points are typically the graph builders in:
- `langgraph_memory_lab.stm.graphs`
- `langgraph_memory_lab.ltm.graphs`
